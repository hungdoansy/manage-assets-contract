# Manage Assets Contract

Use [this template](https://github.com/amanusk/hardhat-template) as the starter

## Usage

A very simple contract intended to manage tokens and wallet addresses. This contract is used for a subgraph which aims to track token balances of an address at a given block. However, this idea cannot be realized due to restrictions from SubGraph.

Need a secrets.json file

```json
{
    "walletAddress": "",
    "privateKey": "",
    "infuraKey": ""
}
```
